const T3_CODE_BROWSER_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS = `## T3 Code collaborative browser

You are running inside T3 Code. The \`t3-code\` MCP server is the product-native collaborative browser shared with the user. When it exposes \`preview_*\` tools, prefer those tools for browser navigation, inspection, interaction, screenshots, and recordings.

For browser work, first call \`preview_status\`. If no automation-capable preview is attached, call \`preview_open\` before concluding that the browser is unavailable. Then use \`preview_navigate\`, \`preview_snapshot\`, and the focused interaction tools. Prefer snapshot-provided locators over coordinates.

Do not switch to global browser skills, Chrome, Node REPL browser automation, standalone Playwright, or agent-browser merely because the preview is initially closed or a first call fails. Use an alternative browser system only when the T3 preview tools are absent, the user explicitly requests another browser, or \`preview_open\` returns an explicit unsupported/unavailable error. A failed T3 preview tool call should be inspected and retried with corrected arguments when the error is actionable.`;

const T3_CODE_DEVICE_TOOL_INSTRUCTIONS = `## T3 Code devices

The \`t3-code\` MCP server also exposes \`device_*\` tools for iOS Simulators and Android Emulators on this environment. For mobile verification, call \`device_list\`, then \`device_open\` so the user can watch the device in their Device panel; its result explains how to drive the device. Driving happens through the \`agent-device\` CLI, which is on PATH. Keep the host config and session flags returned by \`device_open\` on every command so concurrent devices stay independent: prefer \`agent-device snapshot -i\` refs over coordinates, and use \`device_screenshot\` when you need to see the screen. Do not call simctl, adb, xcrun, or serve-sim directly while these tools are present. If \`device_list\` reports a platform as unavailable, say so instead of trying another route.`;
